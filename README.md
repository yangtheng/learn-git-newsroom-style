# Learn Git Newsroom Style

Hey, gumshoe. You're a reporter now. If you want to make it on this job you've
got to learn our tools. We use Git and GitHub to coordinate what we'll write in
our daily paper every day. You'll need to get together a small staff to coordinate
our next publication.

If you're in a city with a competing newspapers try to work as fast as possible to
get these tasks done, merge everything, .ZIP up your issue and Slack it out to
the streets!

Well, get to it!

## Assigning Roles

Get in a team. We need someone to report on each of these topics:

* Local News
* Sports
* Culture

We also need someone to take on a very important role:

* Editor in Chief

Talk among yourselves to figure out what area each of you wants to cover. And make it
snappy! News never stops!

## Editor in Chief

Your responsible to review pull requests and make sure the paper stays in order.
You should be the one that forks this repo once, and everyone else should fork 
from your repo to make pull requests easier.

Don't approve any pull requests that don't merge! If something doesn't merge
easily then send it back to the reporter who contributed the content and tell
them to make sure they merge it with the latest copy of the paper.

## Required Contributions & Revisions
* The local news story about the cat stuck in a tree has an error. The name was
completely wrong. Change all instances of "Sam Cowell" to "Henry Berringer."
* Write a local news column about the cat show going on at city center. It's
called "Paws at the Pumpkin Patch." Remind people there's another one coming up
in February called "My Furry Valentine."
* Someone needs to write a short piece about the "soduku" craze sweeping the
nation. Can someone please get on this and tell me what the heck this is?!
* Spider man is still on the lose harassing citizens. Someone find a picture
of him and upload it to our spiderman folder so we have something on file the
next time he causes us any trouble!! We don't need this picture to appear
in this issue, we just need to have it on file for once.
* Update the final score of the high school basketball game to 93-78. Moonauts
beat the Crows.
* Someone run down to the corner store and buy us a pack of smokes. Geez!
* The weather on the front page needs updating. Can someone fill that in already?
* Anyone worth their salt should take the time to update the front page to
tell people what's actually in this issue. Keep updating it as new stories come
in so we stay on top of the ball for once.
* Who put the board game story under sports? Move it to culture!
* Can someone sort the names of all the plants being unveiled at the greenhouse
thing? Geez, I don't even know what any of those species are.

# Publishing

your satisfaction right-click on the `new-issue` directory, and choose
"Compress 'new-issues'" to create a .ZIP file. send out the zipped up copy of
