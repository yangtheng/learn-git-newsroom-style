Roosevelt High School is hosting an open amateur track meet. Anyone is welcome
to join. Participate in our joggers mile. Everyone writes down their time at
the beginning, no one is allowed to wear a watch during the race and the person
who finishes closest to their estimated time takes home a pie!

Anyone who beats Prima will take home an extra pie!
